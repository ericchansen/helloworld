    "General purpose, high-level, interpreted programming language created by [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/). Apparently, he named Python after the comedical group that he loved, Monthy Python. Released in 1991. Van Rossum was the self proclaimed “benevolent dictator for life” of Python, except he stepped down from his \"for life\" position last year.\n",

    "The best way to start off describing Python is by examining the \"Zen of Python\", written by Tim Peters, another major contributor to the language. It was released as [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). PEP stands for \"Python Enhancement Proposal\". There are quite a few PEP's out there, and many of them provide excellent insight into the contributors' views on the language.\n",

For example, [Instagram](www.instagram.com), [Mozilla's help page](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/), are all built using the Django framework. The machine learning algorithms that we wrote for Eva (which were also written in Python) are made available as a REST API using Flask. The list of possible applications of Python is too vast to exhaust.\n",

    "It's also worth mentioning why not to use Python. Due to Python being an interpretted language that employs automatic garbage collection (and a handful of other reasons), it's not particularly fast at executing. That being said, if you can write something in Python in half the time it takes to write it in C, but it takes twice as long to run in Python than it does in C, which are you going to choose?\n",

I intend to keep updating this documentation throughout the years, and now you all can help too!\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that many of you may be new to working on code collaboratively, but you need something to help you once the team gets beyond 2 or 3 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I had a nice demo built up for this talk. But then someone refactored the code in [featuretools](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools) and broke some of the functionality that I was using. Thanks to GitHub, I can trace the [version history](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools/network) to locate exactly where the [breaking change occured](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools/commit/36ce3c300172390d702a614b5784332b8b56343a). After doing a bit of my own research, I determined this is definitely a bug and reported it to their GitHub issues. Here's [my issue](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools/issues/405). And look at that! They've already responded. Maybe they'll fix the problem themselves. If they don't do it quick enough, I can fork the repo and fix it myself. Then I can propose my changes back to the owners of featuretools as pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, Git allows for a beautiful form of collaboration for both open source and private development. You may be intimidated to get started. Don't be! If you're ever hoping to work with Python or in data science, I promise you that it's worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git References\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Here's the [link to download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You can install it such that it comes with a GUI. Personally, I never use it, but you may like it.\n",
    "1. I recommend learning the basic first. [Start here](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).\n",
    "1. Then think about your Git practices. You want to create [useful, insightful commit messages](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53). [Not this](https://xkcd.com/1296/) or [this](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools/commit/36ce3c300172390d702a614b5784332b8b56343a).\n",
    "1. When you're working on a large project, you'll like want to follow some standard guidelines for managing branches. I like [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). Actually, I use this for all of my current projects, regardless of size.\n",
